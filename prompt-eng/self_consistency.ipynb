    "# Self Consistency Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the more advanced techniques in prompt engineering is self-consistency, introduced by `Wang et al. (2022)`. \n",
    "\n",
    "This method seeks to improve upon the traditional greedy decoding typically used in chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. \n",
    "\n",
    "The core concept involves sampling multiple diverse reasoning paths through few-shot CoT and leveraging these variations to determine the most consistent answer. The technique  enhances the effectiveness of CoT prompting, particularly for tasks requiring arithmetic and commonsense reasoning.\n",

      "### Analysis:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Solution 1**: \n",
      "\n",
      "- **Clarity and Completeness**: The overview is clear about its primary goal of reducing manual summarization time by 50%. It identifies a problem statement well, focusing on inconsistencies due to human errors. However, it lacks clarity around specific objectives other than the two mentioned (implementing an advanced algorithm and incorporating user feedback loops). There's no mention of what exactly constitutes \"key objectives,\" which makes this section somewhat vague.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Accuracy**: The accuracy regarding project details is good but could be improved by specifying more about how the tool will be evaluated or measured for effectiveness. It should include metrics such as time reduction, error rates, and user satisfaction levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Markdown Formatting**: Proper Markdown formatting was used throughout.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Solution 2**: \n",
      "\n",
      "- **Clarity and Completeness**: This version is clearer than Solution 1 with specific objectives mentioned (implementing advanced summarization algorithms and incorporating feedback loops). However, the format of the objectives could be improved for better clarity. The scope section also lacks detail on how the tool will handle different types of content.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Accuracy**: It maintains accuracy regarding project details but might lack some context around the specific technologies or techniques that will be used in implementation (e.g., TextRank).\n",

      "- **Markdown Formatting**: Proper Markdown formatting was maintained.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Solution 3**: \n",
