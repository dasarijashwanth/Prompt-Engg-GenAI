      "## Project Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Project Title:** Research on Financial Literacy Using Machine Learning\n",
      "- **Problem Statement:** Many individuals lack the fundamental knowledge and skills necessary to make informed financial decisions, leading to potential financial instability and vulnerability. This project aims to address this issue by leveraging machine learning techniques to better understand and predict factors influencing financial literacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Goal:** Develop a predictive model using machine learning to identify key drivers of financial literacy and assess individual risk levels.\n",
      "- **Key Objectives:**\n",
      "  - Objective 1: Gather and curate a comprehensive dataset encompassing demographic information, socioeconomic factors, and financial knowledge assessments.\n",
      "  - Objective 2: Employ supervised learning algorithms (e.g., classification, regression) to build a predictive model capable of accurately classifying individuals based on their financial literacy level.\n",
      "  - Objective 3: Identify the most influential features contributing to the prediction model's accuracy and interpret their significance in relation to financial literacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Scope:** This research will focus on building a proof-of-concept predictive model for a specific population group (e.g., young adults, low-income communities). The scope does not include developing a fully deployed application or intervention program.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Methodology\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Data & Methods:**\n",

      "    - Feature Engineering: Preprocess and transform raw data into suitable features for machine learning algorithms. This may involve encoding categorical variables, handling missing values, and creating new features based on domain expertise.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Notebook Code Blocks:**\n",
      "  ```python\n",

      "\n",
      "- **Evaluation Metrics:**\n",
      "    - Accuracy: Measure the percentage of correctly classified instances.\n",
      "    - Precision: Evaluate the model's ability to accurately predict positive cases (individuals with high financial literacy).\n",
      "    - Recall: Assess the model's ability to capture all positive cases.\n",
      "    - F1-Score: Balance precision and recall for a comprehensive performance metric.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Discussion & Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Discussion:** Interpret the results of the predictive model, discussing the most influential factors contributing to financial literacy. Analyze potential limitations of the model and suggest areas for improvement.\n",
      "- **Conclusion:** Summarize key takeaways from the research, highlighting the insights gained into the drivers of financial literacy. Propose future directions for research, such as developing targeted interventions based on the identified risk factors.\n",
